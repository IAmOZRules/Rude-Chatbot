# Rude Chatbot

A mildly rude simple chat-bot made in Python using PyTorch.

##### It's a small chatbot, don't expect much.
##### It's rather rude, but I don't care.

## Instructions to Run:
1. Make sure ```pytorch```, ```numpy```, and ```nltk``` are installed.
> If not, run ```pip install pytorch numpy nltk torchvision```

2. Clone the repository using ```git clone IAmOZRules/Rude-Chatbot.git```

3. Navigate to the repository folder using ```cd Rude-Chatbot```

4. Run ```train.py``` file.

5. Run ```chat.py``` to start the chatbot.

### I didn't put any comments, and I don't plan to do that. So, good luck!
